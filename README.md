# Linear Regression:

Introduction: Predicts outcomes with a straight-line relationship.
Equation: Y=mx+c
Assumptions: Assumes linearity, independence of residuals, and constant residual variance.
Use Cases: Suitable for modeling linear relationships.

# Polynomial Regression:

Introduction: Extends the model to capture more complex, nonlinear patterns.
Equation: Includes polynomial terms up to the nth power of X.
Use Cases: Effective for modeling nonlinear relationships.

# Key Differences:

Flexibility:
Linear Regression assumes a straight-line relationship.
Polynomial Regression accommodates nonlinear patterns.

Overfitting:
Polynomial Regression has a higher risk of overfitting, especially with a high degree.

Interpretability:
Linear Regression models are generally more interpretable.

# Implementation:
This repository includes Python code for both Linear and Polynomial Regression using scikit-learn.
